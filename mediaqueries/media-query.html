        <p>
          7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go
          and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the
          Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall
          prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he
          commandeth them.

          which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where
          will ye leave your glory?
