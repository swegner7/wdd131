      <h4>Title: The Growing Challenge of AI-Assisted Cheating</h4>
      <p>
        As educators, we face an evolving landscape where technology intersects
        with academic integrity. Students, driven by the allure of convenience
        and efficiency, increasingly turn to artificial intelligence (AI) tools
        to gain an unfair advantage during exams. Here are some ways in which AI
        is exploited for cheating:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Automated Answer Generation: Students use AI-powered platforms to
          generate answers swiftly. These tools analyze questions, extract
          relevant information, and produce coherent responses, often bypassing
          the need for genuine understanding or critical thinking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Plagiarism Detection Evasion: AI-driven paraphrasing tools can subtly
          alter content, making it harder for plagiarism detection software to
          flag copied material. Students exploit this to present seemingly
          original work while relying on AI-generated content.
        </li>
        <li>
          Real-Time Assistance: During online exams, students surreptitiously
          consult AI chatbots or virtual assistants. These tools provide instant
          answers, explanations, and even step-by-step solutions, eroding the
          assessment’s validity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Image Recognition: Students snap photos of exam questions and use AI
          image recognition apps to retrieve answers from textbooks, notes, or
          online resources. This method allows them to access information
          without typing a single word.
        </li>
        <li>
          Algorithmic Cheating: Some students manipulate algorithms in adaptive
          learning systems. By intentionally answering questions incorrectly to
          influence subsequent questions, they exploit the system’s design to
          improve their scores.
        </li>
        <p>
          As educators, we must remain vigilant and adapt our strategies to
          combat AI-assisted cheating. Balancing technological advancements with
          academic integrity is a delicate task, but it’s essential to maintain
          a fair and equitable learning environment for all students.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        This page will be an example quiz that demonstrates the dynamic elements
        explained above. It will demonstrate the correct and incorrect answers
        and give an alert to the student.
